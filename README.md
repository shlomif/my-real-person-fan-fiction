# Why I will continue to write my real person fanfiction (fanfic)

## TL;DR Summary

I, [Shlomi Fish](https://www.shlomifish.org/), writer, software developer, and
amateur philosopher, will continue to write [real person
fanfiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction), which is
fiction that depicts famous real-life people, either dead or alive.
This is despite the fact that some people told me I must not because it
can hurt that person’s future and career. I'd like to note why seemingly
Hollywood actors have been jinxed by that, and why it cannot happen to
singers.

## The Technion vs. Project Euler

<img align="right" alt="Portrait of Leonhard Euler" src="./euler.webp" />

I joked that my opinion on [The
Technion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology),
the University where I completed my B.Sc degree in Electrical Engineering (=
"EE") ,has become "untwitterable". The more I think about it, the more it seems
that I think less highly of it, despite the fact that some people told me that
it wasn't a waste of time, and that I'll fondly look back at my studies. Part
of the problem was that I studied there only in order to get my degree (while
I'm not interested in electronics), which I wanted in order to get more
higher-paying jobs.

I paid money to study there, and the people whom were indirectly paid by me,
while sometimes being helpful, often had limited time to help me, looked down
upon me, and gave me hard tests and unfair grades. It destroyed my self-esteem,
harmed my health, made me maniacal, put me on psychiatric drugs which
[harmed my
health](https://github.com/shlomif/why-openly-bipolar-people-should-not-be-medicated)
further, and taught me little of lasting value. Despite paying I
didn't enjoy it, and only did it to get the diploma, so I can get a more
lucrative job later on.

Paying and getting paid made the experience worse. This is the curse of
**professionalism**.

Many years later, I started solving problems at [Project
Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler), one of many [competitive
programming
sites](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/problem-sets-competitive-programming.md).
Since I had quite a bit of math and programming background, I did quite well at
it, and have solved over 300 problems.  I didn't have to pay, but I voluntarily
paid a small donation.  I am still unhappy by the somewhat degraded [user
experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience) of it, but am
otherwise very content.

Despite not paying or expecting to be paid, or rather because of it, I was met
with gratitude, respect and admiration by the people I helped on the [freenode
chat network](https://freenode.net/) with previous problems I solved or by
announcing that I have solved a new one - also without paying.

I was much happier as an **amateur** - someone who does what they do because
they enjoy it and love it, not to get paid. See [Paul Graham’s "What business
can learn from open source"](http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html) .

Lately, by inspiration from a correspondent on an Internet chat who mentioned
someone's one line Résumé, I wrote my ["I'm a Rock Star software developer"
Résumé](https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Software-Dev.html)
where I included only amateur achievements, including Project Euler, and
excluded the Technion. At first I thought it was because EE B.Sc. degrees are
quite common and so not notable enough. But then I realised something else: I
wasn't proud of my EE degree.  These were my most vexing, toxic, soul
destroying, unproductive, six years of my life. I regret doing it for greed of
money.

That junkie stand up comedian whom I saw at a captioned twitter video was
right: if you want to succeed as a writer, entertainer, and amateur philosopher:
don't work "hard".

## Taylor Swift as an amateur

<img align="right" alt="Photo of Taylor Swift" src="./taylor_swift.webp" />

In [this
conversation](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-gnu--think-big),
someone on freenode complained how much he disliked [Apple's
Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) programming
language (which you may not have heard of) and I suggested he charge more -
maybe 300 USD / hour - which he said no one can afford. Its name reminded me of
[Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift) - a successful and
popular singer, who has many videos on YouTube, some of which I am fond of and
which many people praise. You probably heard of her. Now, I told him that she
probably charges more than 300 USD/hour, but the fact of the matter is, she might
perform even for free for something that is important to her, because performing
is fun. Her videos, despite often being popular, probably do not offset their
production value in YouTube ads. But they are good publicity, provide fodder
for remixes, parodies and covers, and are fun enough to produce so she can
afford to sustain the cost. She doesn't work for money or even for a shitload
of money. She works for fun.

There is likely a lot of fanfic, fanart, comments and idolisations of her on
the Internet. She may not improve significantly but she can derive inspiration
and comments from them, and even if she is criticised or held in contempt, she
can either ignore that criticism or learn from it.

If I wrote a Real Person Fanfic of Taylor Swift, she won't be harmed or object.
If I depicted her figuratively "kicking the ass" of the NSA in [Summerschool at
the NSA](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/), it would
not have harmed her reputation a dent, and it may have even give her good
publicity and even fodder for songs or videos.

As an amateur, it would not have harmed her, and I would not have been
considered a villain.

But I did not.

## Sarah Michelle Gellar and Summer Glau

<img align="left" alt="Logo of Summerschool at the NSA" src="./summernsa-logo-small.webp" title="Logo of Summerschool at the NSA" />

Instead I sent the actresses [Sarah Michelle
Gellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar), and [Summer
Glau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau), two actresses who seemed
invaluable for that due to previous associations I had. While their acting
careers were already on the brink of termination, and I depicted them
positively, it likely may have sealed the envelope on both of their Hollywood
careers. But it was probably the best for both, because the Hollywood
professionals were already intimidated by them, and they could be more
productive as non-acting non-professionals activists. Why?

Because they are professionals. The better they played, the more they were
scorned and maligned and given poorer roles by other jealous professional movie
makers who were jealous of their competency and elevated perception by amateur
fans who knew better. There is a whole [YouTube search about why Hollywood
cannot cast X anymore](https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1174571159372935168)
but it is the same old story. To paraphrase on an old [Star Trek (the original
series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series) quote:
"It does not happen some of the time. It happens all the time."

But in the music industry it never happens. It will be very preposterous to
ever see a YouTube feature "Why no one listens to the songs of The Beatles
anymore.".  Moreover, even though [Christina
Grimmie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie) was killed (in part
due to her own mismanagement), and I was shocked and saddened by that, her
songs are still popular. If I now rewrote my screenplay depicting her as a
super intelligent and resourceful female, who kicks the ass of the NSA, people
will think I am helping keep her legacy alive, and revere me for it.

## JK Rowling vs. Me

<img align="right" alt="J. K. Rowling" src="./jk_rowling.webp" />

I want to become the next big writer, but I want to remain writing for fun,
publishing for free [on my site](https://www.shlomifish.org/) under Creative
Commons licences, and writing mostly fanfic or even real person fiction. People
feel sorry for [JK Rowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling) for
being a professional, despite the fact that she is a millionaire.

But people either love my work, respect me, or even think I'm preposterous or
blasphemous (which [indicates I may be
right](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/)).
People would cringe at reading the Harry Potter books now ("TL;DR") but many of
my old [stories, aphorisms or factoids](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/) are
still funny and fresh.

[Emma Watson](https://twitter.com/EmmaWatson) is currently the most highly paid
actress in Hollywood, who rose to fame after having played Hermione in the
Harry Potter films. It makes her comparable to [Arnold
Schwarzenegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger) who also
used to be the highest paid actor.

But it's not as if she is the new Arnold Schwarzenegger. Instead, Arnold
Schwarzenegger will forever be remembered as the old Emma Fuckin’ Watson!

Poor Emma. Why do we feel sorry for her?

Let me try it again. It's not as if Taylor Swift is the new Madonna. In fact,
Swift is the new Socrates! I'm sure Ms. Swift will approve of the new Taylor
Swift factoid.

It does not have to be this way.

## Actors are not replaceable

<img align="left" alt="If Ayn Rand was born in the 1990s, she would be Christina Grimmie" src="./aynrand2grimmie.webp" />

Jewel Staite
[testified](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e3t1f/jewel_staite_ama/cjvt8t9/)
that only she and Summer Glau could have played their characters on
[*Firefly*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_%28TV_series%29).  Similarly
I am more and more convinced that only Emma Watson can play Selina on [my
*Selina Mandrake - The
Slayer*](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/) screenplay but I'd
like her to do it because she enjoys it and work for relatively little. It will
be preposterous to assume that the late Christina Grimmie can ever be replaced
by her YouTuber colleague [Tiffany
Alvord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord) or even by Taylor Swift,
despite the fact that all three were or are wonderful singers.

Actors should become amateurs and work for fun on amateur films they like by
amateur writers, who like me, write mostly fanfic and often crossovers and even
real person fiction. As much as I like [Kermit the Frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_the_Frog) and [Lucky Luke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Luke), they
should [star along Chuck Norris and Summer
Glau](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Summer-Glau-and-Chuck-Norris.html)
because the latter two are equally as awesome even if real. Just like
the old show [*The Muppet Show*](https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Show)
featured celebrity guest stars as themselves.

In Ancient times, most philosophers were entertainers who collected donation
money after their performances, and in fact were closer to today’s entertainers
than our contemporary ivory tower professional philosophers. See:

* [Mel Brooks' Stand up philospher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBIxGjSHzF8)
* [Peter Ustinov: "If Botticelli were alive today he'd be working for Vogue"](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/peter_ustinov_161259)
* ["If Ayn Rand was born in the 1990s she would be Christina Grimmie"](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#if_ayn_rand_was_born_in_the_1990s)
* [ESR's post about why most classical music is a bunch of museum pieces](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4229)

Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee are the last in the line of master professional
warriors (believed to have passed through
[Saladin](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/) himself - one
of the greatest and most underrated
[hackers](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacking-heroism)
of all time). However, I believe that some of the newer amateur [Mixed Martial
Arts (MMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts) fighters could
have [defeated even Bruce Lee](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-english-play-to-lose).

The better the former professional actors like Emma Watson, Sarah Michelle
Gellar, Summer Glau, and Chuck Norris had become the more they were resented,
hated, envied and mistreated. Until it hit their breaking point and they got
angry and burst in rage against their mistreatment. Simply because
they were professionals and worked for as much money as possible.

It is possible that the reason why it seems like the [Chuck Norris
Facts](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/) have made [a
comeback](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#Chuck_Norris)
recently, is because Norris has decided to play in roles he liked, even if he
got paid little or not at all, or was paid after the fact. He became a happy
and respected amateur. I won't be surprised if he sometimes agrees to star in
local school plays, or otherwise star in roles that may seem almost completely
unlike his traditional Hollywood image.

But for now I'll write my real person fic on singers and YouTubers.  I already
have one more factoid about Taylor Swift and there likely will be more. I
assure you that for a long time you won't see a YouTube video "Why people won't
listen to Taylor Swift's songs any more?" Poor Taylor! I'm sure she won't
survive reading this new Taylor Swift Factoid, and sue me immediately.

## Emma Watson

<img align="right" alt="Emma Watson Captioned Image" src="./emma_watson_capt_img.webp" />

Emma Watson is no longer hirable in Hollywood despite the fact that all her
films were commercial successes. And it's because she too became far too
powerful and competent for the incompetent and envious professional film makers
and critics. But like great action heroes (or "hackers") of the past like <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath">David
who fought Goliath</a>, its modernisation in the [Indiana Jones gun
scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YyBtMxZgQs) or the [trailer for
“Hamlet” starring Arnold
Schwarzenegger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Eont_yEGZs), she will not
accept her fate, and bend and break the rules to carve her unique destiny.

She will give Hollywood the fat finger and start producing fan screenplays (in
any conceivable format - not only the overly strict, and pedantic Hollywood
screenplay format, which is hard to get right) that she will sponsor out of her
own pocket. They will depict her as the sexy, competent, bad-ass ass-kicker
that she and her fans know she is rather than her traditional sheepish and
recessive (but not quite) [Hermione
Granger](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger) image, and these
videos will be available free of charge on YouTube. Many awesome male and
female actor hackers who used to be household names but are now unhirable for
becoming too competent, honest and intimidating, will follow suit.

She might opt to make the material available first under relatively restrictive
licences such as
[CC-by-nc-sa](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) or even [All
rights reserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved) and ask to
collect "ransom" money to make it
[CC-by](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) or even [CC0 / Public
Domain](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/). She might give access to
large data files and high quality videos for a pay or sell high quality
collectors sets (just like Nine Inch Nails did with [Ghosts
I-IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_I%E2%80%93IV)).

There are other business models:

* [nayafia/lemonade-stand: A handy guide to financial support for open source](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand)
* [“Alternative” Profitable Models for Web-based Commerce](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/web/models-for-commerce/)

As inconceivable as it seems, I think a
[Terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_%28franchise%29) spoof
with Emma Watson as the evil terminator, and Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to
protect from her has a great potential.  And I already have written crossovers
starring her in anything from an [attack of the software industry's hiring
process](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-applying-for-a-software-dev-job/);
to a
[crossover](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Harry-Potter.html)
of Harry Potter, Sesame Street and other sources of inspiration ; as well as
naturally [*Selina
Mandrake*](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html) which
is a self-concious parody of
[*Buffy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer), mashed up
with Judaism and Israelism, as well as [Star Trek
DS9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine), [The Princess
Bride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29), and [The
Three Musketeers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers).

Hollywood will soon be terminated as an inefficient and lazy oligopoly with
relatively few remaining active franchises, few remaining able and competent
actors who quickly will follow suit, and a flood of indistinguishable high
budget comic books movies with incompetent and unattractive actors who didn't
have the sense and competence to become YouTubers, empty cinemas, and boring
"original" films. Either that or it too will convert to the amateur and
["open"](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/)
models, which like the signed artists labels of the
[RIAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America)
mostly get out of the way (minus some censoring of YouTube content, both
"copyright-violating" and legitimate, which I hope and plan will stop
soon).

If Taylor Swift was able to
[depict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo) her female friends and
herself as bad-ass modern day female warriors, and still continue to outsell her
shows, so should
[Emma Watson](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Emma-Watson/), or
[Gellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar), or [Summer
Glau](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/), or [Megan
Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox), or [Jennifer
Lawrence](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/),
or [Chuck Norris](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/),
or [Tom Cruise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise), or countless other
awesome hackers who would prosper more as amateurs, rather than in the
increasingly money-hungry, soul-sucking, and mind destroying, professional
Hollywood.

Hasta la vista baby! We will be back.

More real person fanfiction. I guess I must never do that.

## Addendum: Commercial use of characters, concepts and worlds

Before the current regime of copyright maximalism, copyright applied
only to text and its printing and reprinting rights. Following
a [discussion](https://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-community/2013-February/008338.html) on the Creative Commons mailing list I have placed
[the copyrights of my characters, concepts, plot elements and worlds](https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/copyrights/#characters_concepts_plots_and_worlds) under the CC-by licence.

It is well known that most creators of commercial worlds effectively cannot and
would rather not enforce noncommercial fan art (fiction, videos, games, etc.) of
their worlds. But why not also allow such works to be sold commercially,
be filmed, or otherwise make a profit?
[**Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom!**](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=perl-petdance-thousand-flowers)

For example, following [Terry
Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett)’s death, his daughter
[Rhianna Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhianna_Pratchett) who is his
inheritor, announced that she closes her father’s
[Discworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld) franchise for commercial
and official sequels. But why not allow commercial and **unofficial** sequels,
prequels, fanart, crossovers / mashups, etc.? Put the franchise under CC-by and
tell the fans that they can build fan art above it as they please and
**request** (not force - see
[Saladin-style](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/))
that a donation be made to the Pratchett's estate, if there was a substantial
profit.

Yet another case of franchise copyrights abuse is that of [“Harry rotters:
Warner Bros cracks down on Potter fan festivals in
US”](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/16/harry-potter-warner-bros-wizard-fan-festivals)
where Warner Bros (who bought the rights to the [Harry Potter
franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter)) demanded that Harry
Potter conventions / festivals not use any names from the books.  I have no
idea how this demand will be "good for the people", help make the world a
better place, and/or ["help someone get
laid"](https://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html). It just seems like a
[dick move](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law) by some overzealous
lawyers.

<img align="right" alt="Talk like a pirate day" src="./Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day.webp" />

And now for the other side of the coin, according to the English Wikipedia
[International Talk Like a Pirate
Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day) (which
is a fun holiday which I celebrate on the Internet, and have also created some
[related fan art](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/)), had become
successful in part because its copyrights or trademarks have not been enforced,
which led to a "viral" growth.

It is likely that creators of commercial franchises would benefit more by
making their worlds, characters, and concepts unrestricted, rather than being
territorial around them. Some of my Internet friends agree with me that
[Spaceballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs) is a better film than
the [original Star Wars
trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Trilogy). However, being a
parody and therefore [fan
art](https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#why_fan_fic), it builds upon the
original work and depends on it.

We are all [**standing on the shoulders of
giants**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants),
so why not let others stand on ours?
