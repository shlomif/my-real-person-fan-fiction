# Why I will continue to write my real person fanfiction (fanfic)

## TL;DR Summary

I, [Shlomi Fish](https://www.shlomifish.org/), writer, software developer, and
amateur philosopher, will continue to write real person fanfiction, even though
some people told me I must not.  However, I'd like to note why it may have been
a blessing in disguise.

## The Technion vs. Project Euler

![Portrait of Leonhard Euler](./euler.webp)

I joked that my opinion on [The
Technion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology),
the University where I completed my B.Sc degree in Electrical Engineering (=
"EE") ,has become "untwitterable". The more I think about it, the more it seems
that I think less highly of it, despite the fact that some people told me that
it wasn't a waste of time, and that I'll reminiscient about my studies. Part of
the problem was that I studied there only in order to get my B. Sc. in
Electrical Engineering (while I'm not interested in electronics), which I
wanted in order to get more higher-paying jobs.

I paid money to study there and the people whom were indirectly paid by me,
while sometimes being helpful, often had limited time to help me, looked down
upon me, and gave me hard tests and unfair grades. It destroyed my self-esteem,
harmed my health, made me maniacal, put me on antipsychotics which harmed
my health further, and taught me little of lasting value. Despite paying I
didn't enjoy it, and only did it to get the diploma, so i can get a more
lucrative job later on.

Paying and getting paid made the experience worse. This is the curse of
professionalism.

Many years later, I started solving problems at [Project Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler), one of many [competitive programming sites](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/problem-sets-competitive-programming.md). Since I had quite a bit of math and programming background,
I did quite well at it having solved over 300 problems.
I didn't have to pay, but I voluntarily paid a small donation.
I am still unhappy by the somewhat degraded [user experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience), but am otherwise very content.

Despite not paying or expecting to be paid, or rather because of it, I was
met with gratitude, respect and admiration by the people I helped on
[freenode](https://freenode.net/) with previous problems I solved or by
announcing that I have solved a new one - also without paying.

I was much happier as an amateur - someone who does what he do because he
enjoys it, not to get paid. See [Paul Graham’s "What business can learn from open source"](http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html) .

Lately, by inspiration from a correspondent on a chat who mentioned someone's
one line Résumé, I wrote my ["I'm a Rock Star"
Résumé](https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Software-Dev.html)
where I included only amateur achievements, including Project Euler, and
excluded the Technion. At first I thought it was because EE B.Sc. degrees are
not notable enough. But then I realised something else: I wasn't proud of my EE
degree.  These were my most vexing, toxic, soul destroying, unproductive, six
years of my life. I regret doing it for greed of money.

That junkie stand up comedian whom I saw at a captioned twitter video was
right: if you want to succeed as a writer, entertainer and amateur philosopher:
don't work "hard".

## Taylor Swift as an amateur

Someone on freenode complained how much he disliked [Apple's
Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)) programming
language (which you may not have heard of) and I suggested he charge more -
maybe 300 USD / hour - which he said no one can afford. Its name reminded me of
[Taylor Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift) - a successful and
popular singer, who has many videos on YouTube, some of which I am fond of and
which many people praise. You probably heard of her. Now, I told him that she
probably charges more than 300 USD/hour, but the fact of the matter she might
perform even for free for something that is important to her because performing
is fun. Her videos, despite often being popular, probably do not offset their
production value in YouTube ads. But they are good publicity, provide fodder
for remixes, parodies and covers, and are fun enough to produce so she can
afford to sustain the cost. She doesn't work for money or even for a shitload of
money. She works for fun.

There is likely a lot of fanfic, fanart, comments and idolisations of her on
the Internet. She may not improve significantly but she can derive inspiration
and comments from them, and even if she is criticised or held in contempt, she
can either ignore that criticism or learn from it.

If I wrote a Real Person Fanfic of Taylor Swift, she won't be harmed or care.
If I depicted her figuratively "kicking the ass" of the NSA in [Summerschool at
the NSA](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/), it would
not have harmed her reputation a dent, and it may have even give her good
publicity and even fodder for songs or videos.

As an amateur it would not have harmed her, and I would not have been
considered a villain.

But I did not.

## Sarah Michelle Gellar and Summer Glau

Instead I sent the actresses [Sarah Michelle
Gellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar), and [Summer
Glau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau), two actresses who seemed
invaluable for that due to previous associations I had. While their acting
careers were already on the brink of termination, and I depicted them
positively, it likely may have sealed the envelope on both of their Hollywood
careers. But it was probably the best for both, because the Hollywood
professionals were already intimidated by them, and they could be more
productive as non-acting non-professionals activists. Why?

Because they are professionals. The better they played, the more they were
scorned and maligned and given poorer roles by other jealous professional movie
makers who were jealous of their competency and elevated perception by amateur
fans who knew better. There is a whole [YouTube search about why Hollywood cannot cast X anymore](https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1174571159372935168) but
it is the same old story. To paraphrase on an old [Star Trek (the original
series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series)
quote: "It does not happen some of the time. It happens all the time."

But in the music industry it never happens. It will be very preposterous to
ever see a YouTube feature "Why no one listens to the songs of The Beatles anymore.".
Moreover, even though [Christina
Grimmie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie) was killed (in part
due to her own mismanagement), and I was shocked and saddened by that, her
songs are still popular. If I now rewrote my screenplay depicting her as a
super intelligent and resourceful female who kicks the ass of the NSA, people
will think I am helping keep her legacy alive and rever me for it.

## JK Rowling vs. Me

I want to become the next big writer, but I want to remain writing for fun,
publishing for free [on my site](https://www.shlomifish.org/) under Creative
Commons licences, and writing mostly fanfic or even real person fiction. People
feel sorry for JK Rowling for being a professional, despite her being a
millionaire.

But people either love my work, respect me or even think I'm preposterous or
blasphemous (which [indicates I may be
right](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/)
). People would cringe at reading the Harry Potter books now ("TL;DR") but many
of my old stories, aphorisms or factoids are still funny and fresh.

[Emma Watson](https://twitter.com/EmmaWatson)
is the most highly paid actress in Hollywood, famous for having played Hermione
in the Harry Potter films. It makes her comparable to
[Arnold Schwarzenegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger)
who also used to be the highest paid actor.

But it's not as if she is the new Arnold Schwarzenegger. Instead, Arnold
Schwarzenegger will forever be remembered as the old Emma Fuckin’ Watson!

Poor Emma. Why do we feel sorry for her?

Let me try it again. It's not as if Taylor Swift is the new Madonna. In fact,
Swift is the new Socrates! I'm sure Ms. Swift will approve of the new Taylor
Swift factoid.

It does not have to be this way.

## Actors are not replaceable

Jewel Staite
[testified](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e3t1f/jewel_staite_ama/cjvt8t9/)
that only she and Summer Glau could have played their characters on [*Firefly*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_%28TV_series%29).
Similarly I am more and more convinced that only Emma Watson can play Selina on
[my *Selina Mandrake - The Slayer*](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/)
screenplay but I'd
like her to do it for fun and work for relatively little. It will be
preposterous to assume that the late Christina Grimmie can ever be replaced by
her YouTuber colleague [Tiffany
Alvord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord) or even by Taylor Swift,
despite the fact that all three were or are wonderful singers.

Actors should become amateurs and work for fun on amateur films they like by
amateur writers who like me write mainly fanfic and often crossovers and even
real person fiction. As much as I like Kermit the Frog and Lucky Luke they
should star along [Chuck Norris and Summer
Glau](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Summer-Glau-and-Chuck-Norris.html)
because they are equally as awesome even if real.

In Ancient times, most philosophers were entertainers who collected donation
money after their performances and in fact were closer to today’s entertainers
rather than the ivory tower professional philosophers. See:

* [Mel Brooks' Stand up philospher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBIxGjSHzF8)
* [Peter Ustinov: "If Botticelli were alive today he'd be working for Vogue"](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/peter_ustinov_161259)
* [If Ayn Rand was born in the 1990s she would be Christina Grimmie](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#if_ayn_rand_was_born_in_the_1990s)
* [ESR's post about why most classical music is a bunch of museum pieces](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4229)

Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee are the last in the line of master professional warriors
(believed to have passed through
[Saladin](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/) himself - one
of the greatest and most underrated [hackers](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacking-heroism) of all time). However, I believe some of
the newer amateur [Mixed Martial Arts
(MMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts) fighters could have
defeated even Bruce Lee.

The better the former professional actors like Emma Watson, Sarah Michelle
Gellar, Summer Glau, and Chuck Norris had become the more they were resented,
hated, envied and mistreated. Until it hit their breaking point and they got
angry and burst in rage against their mistreatment. Simply because
they were professionals and worked for as much money as possible.

It is possible that the reason why it seems like the [Chuck Norris
Facts](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/) have made a
comeback recently, is because Norris has decided to play in roles he liked, even
if he got paid little or not at all, or was paid after the fact. He became a
happy and respected amateur. I won't be surprised if he sometimes agrees to
star in local school plays, or otherwise star in roles that may seem almost
completely unlike his traditional Hollywood image.

But for now I'll write my real person fic on singers and YouTubers.
I already have one more factoid about Taylor Swift and there likely will be more.
And I assure you that for a long time you won't see a YouTube video "Why people
won't listen to Taylor Swift's songs again?" Poor Taylor! I'm sure she won't
survive reading this Taylor Swift Factoid, and sue me immediately.

## Emma Watson

Emma Watson is no longer hireable in Hollywood despite the fact that all her
films were commercial successes. And it's because she too became far too
powerful and competent for the incompetent and envious professional film makers
and critics. But like great action heroes (or "hackers") of the past like <a
href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath">David
who fought Goliath</a>, [the Indiana Jones gun
scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YyBtMxZgQs) or the [trailer for
“Hamlet” starring Arnold
Schwarzenegger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Eont_yEGZs) she will not
accept her fate and bend and break the rules to carve her unique destiny.

She will give Hollywood the fat finger and start producing fan screenplays (in
any conceivable format - not only the overly strict and pedantic Hollywood
screenplay format) that she will sponsor out of her own pocket and depict her
as the sexy, competent, bad-ass ass-kicker that she and her fans know she is
rather than her traditional sheepish and recessive (but not quite) [Hermione
Granger](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger) image, and these
videos will be available free of charge on YouTube. Many awesome male and
female actor hackers who used to be household names but are now unhireable for
becoming too competent, honest and intimidating, will follow suit.

She might opt to make the material available first under relatively restrictive
licences such as
[CC-by-nc-sa](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) or even [All
rights reserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved) and ask to
collect "ransom" money to make it
[CC-by](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) or even [CC0 / Public
Domain](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/). She might give access to
large data files and high quality videos for a pay or sell high quality
collectors sets (like [Ghosts
I-IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_I%E2%80%93IV)).

There are other business models:

* [nayafia/lemonade-stand: A handy guide to financial support for open source](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand)
* [“Alternative” Profitable Models for Web-based Commerce](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/web/models-for-commerce/)

As inconceivable as it seems, I think a
[Terminator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_%28franchise%29) spoof
with Emma Watson as the evil terminator, and Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to protect from her has a
great potential.  And I already have written crossovers starring her in
anything from an [attack of the software industry's hiring
process](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-applying-for-a-software-dev-job/),
to a [Harry Potter and Sesame Street
crossover](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Harry-Potter.html)
(along with [the Donkey from Shrek](https://shrek.fandom.com/wiki/Donkey), [The
Miller, his son and the
donkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller%2C_his_son_and_the_donkey),
and a hack/update of ["All you need is
love"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriters/comments/2aj4p4/do_it_all_with_love_modernisation_hack_of_the/)
), as well as naturally
[Selina](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html) which is
a self-concious parody of Buffy, mashed up with Judaism and Israelism, as well
as [Star Trek DS9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine),
[The Princess
Bride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29), and [The
Three Musketeers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers).

Hollywood will soon be terminated as an inefficient and lazy olygopol with
relatively few remaining active franchises, few remaining able and competent
actors who quickly will follow suit, and a flood of indistinguishable high
budget comic books movies with incompetent and unattractive actors who didn't
have the sense and competence to become YouTubers, empty cinemas, and boring
"original" films. Either that or it too will convert to the amateur and
["open"](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/)
model, which like the signed artists labels of the
[RIAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America)
mostly get out of the way.

If Taylor Swift was able to
[depict](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo) her female friends and
herself as badass modern day female warriors, and still continue to outsell her
shows, so should
[Emma Watson](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Emma-Watson/), or
[Gellar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar), or [Summer
Glau](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/), or [Megan
Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox), [Jennifer
Lawrence](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/),
or [Chuck Norris](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/)
or [Tom Cruise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise) or countless other
awesome action heroes who would prosper more as amateurs rather than in the
increasingly money-hungry soul-sucking and mind destroying professional
Hollywood.

Hasta la vista baby! We will be back.

More real person fanfiction. I guess I must never do that.

## Addendum: Commercial use of characters, concepts and worlds

Before the current regime of copyright maximalism, copyright applied
only to text and its printing and reprinting rights. Following
a discussion on the Creative Commons mailing list I have made
[the copyrights of my characters, concepts, plot elements and worlds under the
CC-by licence](https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/copyrights/#characters_concepts_plots_and_worlds).
It is well known that most creators of commercial worlds effectively cannot and
would rather not enforce noncommercial fan art (fiction, videos, games, etc.) of
their worlds. But why not also allow such works to be sold commercially,
be filmed, or otherwise make a profit?
[**Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom!**](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=perl-petdance-thousand-flowers)

For example, following [Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett)’s death,
his daughter [Rhianna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhianna_Pratchett) who
is his inheritor, announced that she closes
the [Discworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld) franchise for
commercial and official sequels. But why not allow commercial and unofficial
sequels, prequels, fanart, crossovers / mashups, etc.? Put the franchise
under CC-by and tell the fans that they can build fan art above it as they
please and **request** (not force - see [Saladin-style](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/)) that a donation be made to the Pratchett's
estate, if there was a substantial profit.

Yet another case of franchise copyrights abuse is that of [“Harry rotters:
Warner Bros cracks down on Potter fan festivals in
US”](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/16/harry-potter-warner-bros-wizard-fan-festivals)
where Warner Bros (who bought the rights to the Harry Potter franchise)
demanded that Harry Potter conventions / festivals not use any names from the
books.  I have no idea how this demand will be "good for the people", help make
the world a better place, and/or ["help someone get
laid"](https://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html). It just seems like a dick move
by some overzealous lawyers.

And now for the other side of the coin, according to the English Wikipedia [International Talk Like a Pirate Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day) (which is a fun holiday which I celebrate on the Internet,
and have also created some [related fan
art](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/)) had become successful in
part because its copyrights or trademarks have not been enforced, which led to
a "viral" growth.
